# Many Two-Phase Transfers .NET Sample

Code for this sample is in [./Program.cs](./Program.cs).

## Prerequisites

Linux >= 5.6 is the only production environment we
support. But for ease of development we also support macOS and Windows.
* .NET >= 7.0.

And if you do not already have NuGet.org as a package
source, make sure to add it:

```console
dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -n nuget.org
```

## Setup

First, clone this repo and `cd` into `tigerbeetle/src/clients/dotnet/samples/two-phase-many`.

Then, install the TigerBeetle client:

```console
dotnet new console
dotnet add package tigerbeetle
```

## Start the TigerBeetle server

Follow steps in the repo README to [run
TigerBeetle](/README.md#running-tigerbeetle).

If you are not running on port `localhost:3000`, set
the environment variable `TB_ADDRESS` to the full
address of the TigerBeetle server you started.

## Run this sample

Now you can run this sample:

```console
dotnet run
```

## Walkthrough

Here's what this project does.

## 1. Create accounts

This project starts by creating two accounts (`1` and `2`).

## 2. Create pending transfers

Then it begins 5 pending transfers of amounts `100` to
`500`, incrementing by `100` for each transfer.

## 3. Fetch and validate pending account balances

Then it fetches both accounts and validates that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 1500`
 * and `credits_pending = 0`

And that **account `2`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 0`
 * and `credits_pending = 1500`

(This is because a pending transfer only affects **pending**
credits and debits on accounts, not **posted** credits and
debits.)

## 4. Post and void alternating transfers

Then it alternatively posts and voids each transfer,
checking account balances after each transfer.

## 6. Fetch and validate final account balances

Finally, it fetches both accounts, validates they both exist,
and checks that credits and debits for both account are now
solely *posted*, not pending.

Specifically, that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 1500`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 0`
 * and `credits_pending = 0`

And that **account `2`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 1500`
 * `debits_pending = 0`
 * and `credits_pending = 0`
